cookbook.cheesewheel=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|By pressurizing milk repetitively, one's ability to create new foods such as cheese is formed. Cheese wheels are your first steps to healthy food, and an introduction into the food world. This is made in the Cheese Press.><HungerStats|-1|-1|1|4|5.6|Cheese Wheel>
cookbook.cheeseslice=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|Cheese slices are used in many recipes throughout Extra Food. They are mainly used in pizza, and they are also used in sandwiches (notably, the grilled cheese ones.)

cookbook.knife=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|The cutting knife, a staple of any good kitchen, is used for many cutting tasks. These range from cutting meats, fruits and other foods.

cookbook.bacon=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|You've decided that pigs are a great source of alternative meat. Despite your love for AntVenom (Anti-pig killing) and OhaiIchun, you see the usefulness of pigs: BACON. Using the knife you made earlier, you can kill pigs and get bacon as a drop.

cookbook.spread=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|You have decided to use the fruits and nuts you've found in order to make spreads. These "spreads" taste very good in a sandwich, but you've questioned the safety of eating them alone. They seem to give you weird effects, and your not sure if that is good or bad!><HungerStats|-1|-1|2|2.5|5.0|Jelly><Crafting|-1|-1|3|jelly><HungerStats|-1|-1|4|4.0|4.5|Chocolate Spread><Crafting|-1|-1|5|chocolateSpread><HungerStats|-1|-1|6|1.5|4.5|Peanut Butter><Crafting|-1|-1|7|peanutButter>
cookbook.grater=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|To cut all your food finer than your knife does, you've invented a grater. This has been very useful in refining natural foods to a more spreadable kind. You feel like one day, this will become even more useful><Crafting|-1|-1|1|grater>

These seem to have a low health value, but combinding them other foods may fix that.><TextBlock|-1|-1|2|You have also seen some nice yellow fruits hanging off trees. When you break the block, you've notice you can get anywhere from 4 - 6 edible bananas! The leaves also drop saplings to regrow the trees.><Image|-1|-1|2|extrafood:textures/gui/cookbookimages/WorldGen.png|75|40|150|0><HungerStats|-1|-1|3|2|0.8|Banana>
cookbook.plants=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|In order to fully expand your tastebuds, you started to hit grass. Though unexciting, while you hit it, different seeds dropped.

cookbook.autocutter=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|Realizing the cutting potential of the knife caused you to have a spontaneous good idea! You seem to have automated the knife, and compressed the entire contraption into the size of a block.
