#cookbook.pizza=Pizza is a extremely yummy meal, and it can provide, when eaten whole, up to 5 hunger points. To make pizza, you need to make pizza dough. Pizza dough can be made with two type of bread, whole wheat and regular.

cookbook.cheesewheel=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|By pressurizing milk repetitively, one's ability to create new foods such as cheese is formed. Cheese wheels are your first steps to healthy food, and an introduction into the food world. This is made in the Cheese Press.><HungerStats|-1|-1|1|4|5.6|Cheese Wheel>
cookbook.cheeseslice=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|Cheese slices are used in many recipes throughout Extra Food. They are mainly used in pizza, and they are also used in sandwiches (notably, the grilled cheese ones.) Their other use is to be a snack, healthier than an entire cheese wheel.><Crafting|-1|-1|1|cheeseslice><HungerStats|-1|-1|2|1|3.0|Cheese Slice>
cookbook.knife=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|The cutting knife, a staple of any good kitchen, is used for many cutting tasks. These range from cutting meats, fruits and other foods. When killing entities, such as the pig, rare drops may occur, such as bacon or in the case of young cows, veal.><Crafting|-1|-1|1|knife>
cookbook.bacon=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|You've decided that pigs are a great source of alternative meat. Despite your love for AntVenom (Anti-pig killing) and OhaiIchun, you see the usefulness of pigs: BACON. Using the knife you made earlier, you can kill pigs and get bacon as a drop. This can be eaten in it's raw form (although not recommended) and can also be cooked into the><TextBlock|-1|-1|1|perfect delectable slice of meat.><HungerStats|-1|-1|2|0.5|0.6|Bacon><HungerStats|-1|-1|3|1|5.2|Cooked Bacon>
cookbook.cheesepress=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|The cheese press is the first simple machine from Extra Foods. Requiring no power, it will convert milk buckets into cheese wheels. This will be your first steps into the "new age", where you can eat more foods of different types and not be stuck with Pork, Steak and carrots!><Crafting|-1|-1|1|cheesepress><TextBlock|-1|-1|2|To use this block, you must put 3 milk buckets into the top slots (1). This can also be done with hoppers and any form of automation from the top/all sides of the block. Cheese Wheels will appear in the bottom slot (2), and can be pulled out with hoppers or automation from the bottom of the block. Empty buckets can also be pulled out from the><TextBlock|-1|-1|3|bottom of the block.><Image|-1|-1|3|extrafood:textures/gui/cookbookimages/CheesePressGUIHelper.png|105|79|0|0>

cookbook.SeaWater=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|Upon living in this world of Minecraftia, you discover that sometimes the foods you find or make just are not enough to satisfy your hunger. You've plotted different ways of solving this, but have ended up with only failiure. As you see an animal drinking at a river, an idea hits you. By combining the ability to pickup liquids through a bucket with   the lake water, you discover Sea Water, a salty, but drinkable fluid. In order to get rid of that horrible taste, you can place the sea water into a furnace, creating purified water. You note the fact that placing this water down will recreate "water" and cannot naturally be found.><HungerStats|-1|-1|2|1|0.1>
cookbook.Bread=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|In order to lessen the amount of starvation, you have cut the loaf of bread you made into slices. These will be very useful for other food, such as the sandwich and can be put into a furnace to be lightly  toasted, thus making toast.><Crafting|-1|-1|0|Bread><HungerStats|-1|-1|2|2|3.0|Sliced Bread><HungerStats|-1|-1|3|2|0.8|Toast>
cookbook.sandwiches=<TextBlock|-1|-1|0|By mixing different foods together, you have created a new array of things to eat. In this newest creation of yours, you've slapped some different items between bread, and created a "Sandwich". These will light up your taste buds and are very easy to craft. You've written down some of the better tasting sandwiches in the><TextBlock|-1|-1|1|following pages.><HungerStats|-1|-1|2|4|9.0|PB&C Sandwich><Crafting|-1|-1|3|sandwichPBN><HungerStats|-1|-1|4|4|9.5|PB&J Sandwich><Crafting|-1|-1|5|sandwichPBJ><HungerStats|-1|-1|6|4|10.0|BLT><Crafting|-1|-1|7|sandwichBLT>
