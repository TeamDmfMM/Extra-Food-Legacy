Extra Food
==========
Is a mod by dmf444 and mincrmatt12 that adds extra world gen, machines and most importantly: food.
This entire mod is designed so that a player can have more food option instead of just steak, pork and carrots/potatos.

This mod is also designed to work with Starvation Ahoy (working title) our other mod that completely changes minecrafts hunger system, adding in calories, allergies and fitness.
